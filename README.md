By Alfa Akifuna Fi'lalk Hoirot

1. Business Understanding

Conducted business understanding to identify the card brands and card types most frequently used by customers. The analysis employed a Pareto diagram to focus on the few key categories that have the greatest impact on transaction behavior. This approach highlighted the dominant card categories that contribute most significantly to transaction volume. The insights gained help the company make more informed and strategic business decisions.

2. Data Undestanding

Based on the analysis objectives, the variables used include customer, card, transaction, and demographic information, such as client_id, card_brand, card_type, has_chip, credit_limit, amount, merchant_city, merchant_state, errors, current_age, birth_year, gender, address, per_capita_income, yearly_income, total_debit, credit_score, and generation. These variables were used to understand card usage patterns, customer characteristics, and transaction behavior. The data allowed for identifying customer segmentation based on demographic and financial factors.

3. Data Preporcessting

During the data preprocessing stage, missing data and duplicate records were checked to ensure dataset quality. Data types were then adjusted to maintain consistency across the dataset. Data from three sources were combined using JOIN queries to create an integrated dataset. Only relevant variables were selected for data exploration. This process ensured that the data was ready for further analysis.

4. Data Exploration

During the data exploration stage, the most frequently used card brands and card types by customers were analyzed along with their impact on the company. The geographic origin of customers was examined to understand the distribution of transactions. Customer demographics were also analyzed based on gender and generation for better segmentation. Additionally, data security checks on customer information were performed. The insights were visualized in an interactive dashboard using Looker Studio to support informed business decision-making.

5. Summary and Recommendation

The summary and recommendation stage was conducted after completing the data exploration process. Key findings from the data analysis were consolidated to provide a comprehensive overview. Based on the exploration results, actionable recommendations were developed to support business decision-making. This process helps the company understand important insights from the data and determine strategic next steps.

Note: The entire workflow has been documented in the data analytics report.
